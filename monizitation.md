# 💰 SneakySpeak Monetization Plan

## 🎯 Overview
Monetization in SneakySpeak is centered around the **Anonymous Messaging feature**, turning it into a fun but valuable mechanic. Users start with free coins and need to buy more via Paystack when they run out.

## 🪙 Coin System

### 🎁 First-Time Bonus:
- ✅ New users get **10 free coins** upon their first login.

### 💬 Coin Usage:
| Action                            | Coin Cost |
|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Send normal (non-anonymous) text | 0         |
| Send **anonymous** text message  | 2 coins   |
| Send **anonymous** image/meme    | 4 coins   |

### 💸 Refill System:

  - 💰 100 coins – ₦700

### 📲 Coin Display:
